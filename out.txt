 I've been here, maybe too many times I know it like my hand, covered in all its lines
 Cause if they see what I see, they knew what I knew, they'd end up like me too
 And then the white parallel lines don't fit
 When the sky turns upside down, I'll fade into you
 Like I always do
 Wake up repeated, it's getting too deep, wake up repeated
 But I keep on blaming myself, saying it's time, it's my dream
 And then I go back to sleep
 And then I go back to sleep
 They seem like faces I should know, but I can't find out
 Where they all came from, cause if they act like I act, I do what I do
 They end up like me too
 And then the white parallel lines don't fit
 When the sky turns upside down, I'll fade into you
 Like I always do
 Wake up repeated, it's getting too deep, wake up repeated
 But I keep on blaming myself, saying it's time, it's my dream
 And then I go back to sleep
 Wake up repeated, it's getting too deep, wake up repeated
 But I keep on blaming myself, saying it's time, it's my dream
 And then I go back to sleep
